# Heart-Diseases-Prediction
Heart Attacks are the major cause of death in the world today, particularly in India. The need to predict this is a major necessity for improving the country's healthcare sector. Accurate and precise prediction of the heart disease mainly depends on Electrocardiogram (ECG) data and clinical data. These data's must be fed to a nonlinear disease prediction model. 
INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the highest flying diseases of the modern world. According to a survey, about more than 17.7 million deaths occur all across the world annually due to heart diseases. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million were due to coronary heart disease and 6.7 million were due to stroke. Heart Attacks are one of the most deadly diseases which can knock one down at any point of time without any invitation and silent heart attacks are something which most doctors are not able to predict. The lack of specialists and increasing wrong diagnosed cases have necessitated the need for building an efficient cardiovascular disease prediction system. This has led to research and development of new medical data mining techniques and various machine learning techniques. The main objective of this work is to identify the key patterns and features from the medical data using the classification algorithms and then to select the most relevant attributes for silent heart attack diagnosis. The use of Recurrent Neural Network will further enhance the accuracy of the results

OBJECTIVES of The Project

Heart disease is the number one killer according to World Health Organization (WHO) statistics. 
Prediction of heart disease early plays a crucial role for the treatment. If heart disease could be predicted before, lots of patient deaths would be prevented and also a more accurate and efficient treatment way could be provided. The important key points of such medical diagnosis systems are reducing cost and obtaining more accurate rate efficiently. 

Scope of the Project

Our project major challenge facing healthcare organizations (hospitals, medical centers) is the provision of quality services at affordable costs. Quality service implies diagnosing patients correctly and administering treatments that are effective.

Existing System

The existing system used for prediction of heart attack are failing to meet the desired accuracy in the results. As seen in the literature survey, the machine learning techniques used are pushing the accuracy till a certain limit. Moreover, the issue with the present heart attack prediction system is the uses of attributes. The attributes to be selected for the prediction of heart attack are the conventional ones and thus the results are generating wrong results many-a-times. The proposed model aims to extract the proper attributes from the datasets which will enhance the precision of the prediction. It will also provide the users with proper diagnosis so that the user understands the problem well without much difficulty.

Disadvantages
The present system has certain major disadvantages. A few to be listed below.
1) No accurate result.
2) While selection for the prediction of heart disease are the conventional ones and thus the results are generating wrong results.

Proposed System

The proposed system project sets itself apart by harnessing the powers of both Deep learning and data mining. The paper proposes a system, with a strong prediction algorithm, which implements powerful classification steps with a comprehensive report generation module. The project aims to implement a selflearning protocol such that the past inputs of the disease outcomes determine the future possibilities of the heart disease to a particular user. The proposed model makes use of strong preprocessing tools so that the classification and prediction do not show any errors relating to the dataset. A huge no. of training sets will be used to make the prediction more and more accurate.
